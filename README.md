# Spotify Controller

This project is a device built to control Spotify using its API alongside various hardware components. It can change volume, skip/back tracks, pause/play, and like/dislike songs. This project marked my introduction to the world of embedded systems.

It's a simplified version of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWiPIBWvgIU&t=2s), but doesn't include a display, and uses an ESP32 instead of an ESP8266. 

## Demo

You can see pictures, videos and read about my experience with this project [here](https://bolota.eu/posts/8_embedded_programming).

## Files in This Repository
This repository contains two files:
- `spotify.ino`: The main Arduino code for controlling the device.
- `index.h`: The header file that includes the HTML for logging into spotify.
